This is my Python based application that lets you perform many tasks with your Google Play Music library and playlists which you cannot do in the web interface. 

Please visit my website http://apps.hovav.org/google-play-music-utility for full installation and usage instructions.

I have tested and run my application on Windows, Linux and OS X/

Some of the features you can do with my application:

Compare 2 playlists and get a CSV file that lists songs that are in both playlists
Create a new playlist from a previously exported CSV file
Delete a playlist
Download all songs in a playlist to your computer
Duplicate an existing playlist
Export the list of songs in a playlist into a support export format (Currently CSV or HTML)
Export the list of songs in all playlists into a support export format as individual files for each playlist (Currently CSV or HTML)
Export the list of songs in your entire Google Play Music Libraryinto a support export format (Currently CSV or HTML)
View songs added since a specified date and save the results to a CSV file.
Rename a playlist

Any function that lets you save a file has the option to either save the file locally or use Dropbox OAuth to save it directly to Dropbox.

In addition to these features, you can perform all of the functions above using command line arguments and customize the color coding when exporting a file as HTML .

The application has a built-in update checker which will let you know when an update is available and will prompt you to open a browser window to download the update.
